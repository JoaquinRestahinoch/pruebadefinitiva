      "quality_issues": [
        "Distracting background elements (other furniture, busy setting)",
        "Inconsistent lighting/color temperature (warm yellow cast)",
        "Shadows on the floor creating uneven lighting",
        "Product is not centered, and parts are cut off (bottom left corner)",
        "The environment looks like a showroom, not a natural home setting for lifestyle shots"
      ],
      "notes": "The sofa is a modern two-seater with button-tufted back cushions and clean lines. The fabric has a subtle texture. For e-commerce, it would benefit from a clean studio background or a well-styled living room scene with balanced, soft lighting to accurately represent its color and style."
